# Summary

Just a repo to save any files related to the ergogen based keyboard I'm trying to build off of https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux

## Changes from the original A.dux
- Changed footprint to `mx`
- Changed the spread and stagger for some columns
- Increased the size of the `raw` outline
- In Kicad
    - repositioned the `promicro` & `trrs` a little bit
    - randomly moved the "empty circles" to edges of the pcb
    - slightly changed the edges of the pcb

## Current status in Kicad(has a bunch of drilled holes too close and another error):
